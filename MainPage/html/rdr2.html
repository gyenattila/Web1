      <h2> Arthur Morgan</h2>

      <img id="arthur" src="../img/rdrPics/arthurMorganProfile.jpg" alt="Arthur Morgan" >

      <article>
        <p>
          Arthur Morgan was born in 1863 to <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Beatrice_Morgan" 
          target="_blank"> Beatrice </a> and Lyle Morgan. His mother died when he was very young, and his father
          was a petty criminal and outlaw, who was arrested for larceny in 1874 when Arthur was 11 years old. At some point, 
          Lyle was killed and Arthur witnessed it, donning his hat afterwards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Around 1878, Arthur was picked up by <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Dutch_van_der_Linde"
          target="_blank">Dutch van der Linde</a> and <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Hosea_Matthews"
          target="_blank">Hosea Matthews</a>. Viewing him as an adoptive father figure, Arthur came to share Dutch's vision of a 
          life lived free from civilization and the rule of law, becoming one of the first members of the 
          <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Van_der_Linde_gang" target="_blank">Van der Linde gang</a>. 
          At some point during his youth, Arthur met a girl named Mary Gillis and the two were deeply in love. However, Arthur's 
          preference for a life of crime and the prevalent disapproval of Mary's family caused their relationship to fall 
          through.
        </p>

        <p>
          At some point later, Arthur met and slept with a young waitress named Eliza, resulting in her becoming pregnant with 
          their son Isaac. Eliza knew what Arthur was, but accepted whatever support he offered to her and their son. Arthur 
          would visit Eliza and Isaac every few months and stay with them for days at a time. One day, Arthur arrived at their 
          home and saw two crosses outside. Arthur knew immediately that they were both dead, and later learned that they were 
          killed by robbers, all for ten dollars. The incident hardened Arthur ever since and he never truly coped with the 
          pain.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a botched ferry heist, Dutch and the gang are forced to flee Blackwater and attempt to cross the mountains west 
          to evade law enforcement. Not long after relocating to Colter, Dutch and Arthur go looking for either John Marston or 
          Micah Bell, who went scouting. Arthur and Dutch find Micah, who tells them of a homestead which appears to have a 
          party going on inside. They stop at a homestead to ask for help, where they encounter members of the O'Driscoll Boys. 
          After meeting them, a gunfight breaks out, which results in the deaths of the O'Driscolls. After looting the ranch, 
          they encounter Sadie Adler, whose husband was killed by the enemy gang. Feeling bad for her, they bring her back to 
          camp. Not long after returning, Arthur is asked by Abigail Roberts to find John Marston, who has gone missing. Arthur 
          and Javier Escuella find John wounded from being attacked by wolves, and bring him back to camp.

      <h2>Dutch van der Linde</h2>

      <img id="dutch" src="../img/rdrPics/dutchProfile.jpg" alt="Dutch van der Linde" >

      <article>
        <p>
          Dutch was born in 1855 to an unnamed Dutch father and an English woman called Greta. Little is known about his younger 
          days. His father fought for the Union in the American Civil War and died in a battle (heavily implied to be the Battle 
          of Gettysburg). Because of his father's death, Dutch seems to have developed a grudge against Southerners. Dutch also 
          mentions that he left his home when he was 15 years old because he rarely got along with his mother, who died in 1881 
          and was buried in Blackwater, although Dutch only found out several months after this from an uncle of his.
        </p>

        <p>
          He valued freedom and liberties above all else and dreamed of living an independent existence. To attain these 
          desires, Dutch began to resort to a life of crime. In the early days of his criminal life, Dutch had an "odd" 
          partnership with <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Colm_O%27Driscoll" target="_blank">
          Colm O'Driscoll </a>, a fellow infamous outlaw and the leader of his own gang. At some point, Dutch met 
          and befriended Hosea Matthews, a con artist who tried to rob Dutch who likewise tried to do to do the same to Hosea. 
          Dutch and Hosea decided to partner up and later formed their own gang. Notable members that joined the gang at various 
          times include 
          <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur_Morgan"  target="_blank">Arthur Morgan</a>, 
          <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Micah_Bell" target="_blank">Micah Bell</a>, 
          <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/John_Marston" target="_blank">John Marston</a>,
          <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Abigail_Marston" target="_blank"> Abigail Marston </a>,
          <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Bill_Williamson" target="_blank">Bill Williamson </a>, and 
          <a class="innerLink" href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Javier_Escuella" target="_blank">Javier Escuella </a>. 
          At some point later, Dutch and Colm became bitter enemies after Dutch killed Colm's brother and Colm killed Dutch's 
          lover Annabelle in retaliation, sparking a long blood feud between both gangs.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this time, Dutch was an altruistic and idealistic rogue, believing the gang could make a difference in the world. 
          He fashioned himself into something of a Robin Hood-like figure, taking money from the rich and wealthy who had plenty 
          of it, and giving it to the poor and destitute who needed it. He saw himself as a symbol of the Wild West in its 
          romanticized form, and a humanitarian champion of the people, opposing government control, supporting individual 
          liberty and punishing general human cruelty and selfishness. His romantic image and charisma inspired his gang to 
          believe in his anarchistic vision of a "Savage Utopia", and it was in the name of Dutch and his cause that they 
          committed many violent crimes such as murder and robbery. By 1899, Dutch was reluctantly starting to realize that the 
          way of life he held so dear was fast becoming an unrealistic proposition and that the days of the Wild West were fast 
          coming to an end.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Van der Linde gang attempted an ambitious ferry robbery in Blackwater, but it ended in disaster and the gang was 
          forced to flee into the blizzard mountains of Ambarino to escape the heat. The specifications of the heist are never 
          fully revealed, but it's known that Dutch killed a defenseless young mother named Heidi McCourt during it. The events 
          of Blackwater shook Hosea's faith in Dutch, though he admits that his faith in their mission had been dead for a long 
          time before this.

      <h2>John Marston</h2>

      <img id="john" src="../img/rdrPics/johnProfile.jpg" alt="John Marston" >

      <article>
        <p>
          John Marston was born in 1873. His father was an illiterate Scottish immigrant, who was born on the boat into New York, 
          while his mother was a prostitute, who passed away during John's birth. John's father was blinded in both eyes during a bar 
          fight south of Chicago. His father loved to talk about Scotland and hated the English for what they did to his 
          great-grandparents, although he never met them.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1881, John's father died. John was only eight years old at the time and was sent to an orphanage, where he spent the next 
          few years. He eventually ran away and tried to make his own luck living out in the streets. At the age of 11, John committed 
          his first murder when he shot a man, though he claimed it was not his fault. In 1885, at the age of 12, Marston had been 
          caught stealing by homesteaders in Illinois, who planned on hanging him. Dutch van der Linde stepped in and saved the young 
          boy, taking him under his wing. John joined the Van der Linde gang alongside Hosea Matthews, Arthur Morgan, and Susan 
          Grimshaw. The gang became a surrogate family to the young boy, with Dutch becoming his mentor and father figure. He taught 
          John how to shoot, hunt, gather, read, and instilled him with a love of nature and things other than power.
        </p>

        <p>
          John had become an outlaw and gunslinger. He ran with Dutch, Bill Williamson, Arthur Morgan, Javier Escuella, and several 
          others, committing robberies, raids, murders, kidnappings, and other crimes across the frontier. Marston, alongside Morgan, 
          quickly became one of Dutch's proudest protégés. Many members of the gang considered John to be Dutch's favorite and "golden 
          boy", much to the envy of certain people, such as Bill.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marston had fallen under the sway of Dutch's philosophy, believing that the gang stole and fought for a reason. In stealing 
          from the rich, they, in turn, gave to the poor. They wanted to elicit change in the people of the West, although he later 
          came to admit that these were excuses to let them rob and steal indiscriminately.
          In 1894, a prostitute named Abigail Roberts joined the gang. Despite having sexual relations with most of the gang members, 
          she eventually fell in love with John. Together they had a son named Jack. The gang became an extended family to Jack, with 
          most of the members becoming aunts and uncles to him. In his early years, John had a lot of difficulties connecting with his 
          son due to doubts as to whether or not he's Jack's biological father as well as fears about his own ability to raise him. 
          Around the time Jack was one year old, John left the gang for a year. His return was met well with Dutch and certain other 
          members of the gang, whilst Arthur Morgan felt betrayed by his actions. A rift between the two steadily grew over the next 
          few years.
