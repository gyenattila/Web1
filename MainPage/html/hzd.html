            Entertainment</a>. It was released for the <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a> in early 2017. The plot follows <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloy" target="_blank">Aloy</a>, a hunter in a world 
            overrun by machines, who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranged_weapon" target="_blank">ranged weapons</a>, a spear, and stealth to

              <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> is Guerrilla Games' first intellectual property since <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone_(video_game)" target="_blank">Killzone</a> in 2004 and also its first 
              role-playing game. Development began in 2011 after the completion of <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone_3" target="_blank">Killzone 3</a>, with director Mathijs de Jonge 
              considering it the riskiest idea pitched at the time. The game engine, Decima, was developed for <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone_Shadow_Fall" target="_blank">Killzone Shadow</a> 
              Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. Anthropologists were consulted to authenticate the world's decay over a 
              millennium. The soundtrack, led by composer Joris de Man, contains experimental instrumentation.

          <p>
            <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i> won numerous awards, and critics praised its open world, story, visuals, combat, 
            characterisation, and the performance of voice actress Ashly Burch; however, the dialogue, melee combat, and 
            character models received some criticism. By <time datetime="2019-02-11"> February 2019</time>, the game had sold over 10 million copies, making it 
            one of the <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PlayStation_4_video_games" target="_blank">best-selling PlayStation 4 games</a>. An expansion, <em>The Frozen Wilds</em>, was released in <time datetime="2017-11-14"> November 2017</time>.

          <h2>Game Play</h2>
          <p>
            Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game played from a third-person view. Players take control of Aloy, a 
            hunter who ventures through a postapocalyptic land ruled by robotic creatures. Aloy can kill enemies in a variety 
            of ways - setting traps such as tripwires using the Tripcaster, shooting them with arrows, using explosives, and a 
            spear. Machine components, including electricity and the metal they are composed of, are vital to Aloy's survival; 
            she can loot their remains for crafting resources. Ammo, resource satchels, pouches, quivers; resistance, 
            antidotes, health potions, and traps can all be crafted. Weapons have modification slots for dealing more damage
          </p>

          <p>
            Aloy wears a Focus, a small head piece that scans machines to determine their susceptibilities, identify their 
            location, their level, and the nature of loot they will drop. One machine, the Stalker, can enable cloaking 
            technology to avert the gaze of Aloy's Focus scan. Machines attack with defensive and offensive measures, and 
            in either case react to a perceived threat by charging at it with brute force or projectiles. Exhibiting the 
            behaviour of wild animals, some machines are inclined to move in herds, and others, with the ability to fly, do so 
            in flocks. Unless hacked with the Override Tool, machines do not exert aggressive force against each other. Aloy 
            engages in battle with the cult known as the Eclipse. She can dodge, sprint, slide, or roll to evade her 
            enemies' advances. Hiding in foliage to ambush nearby enemies can ensure immediate takedowns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Swimming may reach enemies stealthily or places otherwise unreachable on foot. She is able to hack a selection 
            of machines with the Override Tool, some of which can be turned into makeshift mounts. Explorable ruins 
            called Cauldrons exist to unlock additional machines to override. Three categories occur in the skill tree: 
            "Prowler" concerns stealth, "Brave" improves combat, and "Forager" increases healing and gathering 
            capabilities. To level up, Aloy attains experience points from individual kills and completing quests. 
            Upgrades in each category result in more adept use of the skills learned, with "Prowler" leading to silent 
            takedowns, "Brave" to aiming a bow in slow motion, and "Forager" to an enlarged medicine pouch. The Frozen 
            Wilds added "Traveller", which unlocks the ability to jump off a mount to attack enemies.The game has a 
            seamless open world with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system
          </p>

          <p>
            The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed 
            with the employment of parkour, and aided by the use of zip-lines installed throughout the world.
            Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with 
            more aggression. To uncover more of the map, one must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks.[29] 
            Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by 
            interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of 
            tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering 
            materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of 
            bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the 
            five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage. A 
            dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-player characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer 
            visual information of the Old World, metal flowers that contain poetry, and old relics, such as ancient mugs and 
            tribal artefacts.
