        <p>
          <cite>
            "I'm just a fat washed up jock who can't get his head around the fact his high school f
            ootball career didn't play out the way that he planned.

          ―Michael during his therapy session.
        </p>

        <p>
          Michael was born in either <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Michael_De_Santa#COMMUNITY_VOTE:_Michaels_age_put_in_as_1965.2F1968_or_Mid-Late_1960s.3F" target="_blank">1965 or 1968</a>, possibly in the <a class="innerLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States" target="_blank">Midwest</a>, which would explain why he 
          spent some of his criminal career in North Yankton or
          on the East Coast, possibly indicating why he committed his first robbery in the outskirts of 
          Carcer City. As a child, he didn't have the luxuries 
          and privileges that his own children have and grew up in the deprived environment of a trailer 
          park with his parents. Like Trevor and Franklin, 
          Michael had a tough upbringing due to his father being an alcoholic and physically abusing him. 
          Michael's father soon abandoned him and his mother. 
          He was told an exaggerated amount of stories of why his father left, all of which included (but 
          weren't limited to) him skipping town, being hit by 
          an oncoming train and even joining the navy. During his time in high school, Michael was an 
          acclaimed quarterback for an all-state football team. 
          Michael would often put on an amazing performance during games and occasionally had his picture 
          in the local newspaper, but his temperament issues 
          and a constant stream of injuries ultimately forced him to quit.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a young adult, Michael started breaking the law. According to Michael, he'd been in prison 
          twice by the time he was twenty. He committed his 
          first robbery in the outskirts of Carcer City in 1988, where he managed to steal $10,000 from a 
          small business. While in prison, Michael learned 
          many skills, including learning how to use a tattoo gun by tattooing his name on his cellmate's 
          buttocks. Despite his failures and shortcomings, 
          Michael perfected his criminal skills to the point where he became an expert marksman and 
          efficient leader amongst other things. During this period 
          of time, he associated himself with Lester Crest, an exquisite planner that would later assist 
          Michael in planning out heists, as well as other 
          tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1993, Michael met <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Trevor_Philips" target="_blank">Trevor Philips</a> while he was escorting cargo across the border. While 
          Trevor waited on the runway to meet his unknown employer, 
          he noticed not one, but two dust trails coming up the road, despite the fact that he was told 
          there'd only be one person meeting him with the cargo. 
          Michael exited the first vehicle, while an older civilian exited the second. As it turned out, 
          the older civilian had been carjacked by Michael. As 
          Michael tried to make a hasty escape on foot, the older civilian attempted to get Trevor's 
          attention as to what just happened. Trevor approached the 
          civilian and fired off a flare gun into the man's eye, brutally killing him. He and Michael 
          dumped the body into a lake after landing a plane. 
          Trevor stated that the experience was horrible, as the flare was still burning from the inside 
          of the man's skull as they dropped him off into the 
          lake. Trevor and Michael both threw up after landing the plane since the dead man's stench was 
          still inside the cockpit. After noticing how well 
          they worked with each other, Michael brought an aimless Trevor under his wing as a partner for 
          various crimes he would commit. They were both 
          somewhat successful at their profession, but Michael claims that they were always impecunious 
          and constantly on the run from the law, as Trevor's 
          rage issues would cause him to murder someone in broad daylight and Michael's circumspection 
          and foresight as well as his distinctive style of 
          quoting from Solomon Richards' films (thus drawing attention) would cause him and Trevor to 
          leave town after completing a job.

        <p>
          <cite>
            "Look homie, I don't mind dying. You feel me? But I just want to die over something that 
            matters, homie. That's what Forum Gangsters should really be about."
          </cite>
          <br>
          <br>
          ― <strong>Franklin Clinton</strong> to <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Lamar_Davis" target="_blank">Lamar Davis</a> in the mission Chop
        </p>

        <p>
          Franklin was born in <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/South_Los_Santos" target="_blank">South Los Santos</a>, <strong>San Andreas</strong> in 1988. He never knew his father and his 
          mother became a cocaine addict when Franklin was very young. As a child, Franklin often heard 
          stories about how his father was violent and physically abusive towards his mother, possibly 
          causing her to turn to cocaine to escape being abused. Franklin's father left his mother while 
          she was still pregnant with Franklin. His mother's addiction eventually led to her death when Franklin was a little boy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following his mother's death, he moved in with his maternal grandparents. This is where 
          Franklin met Tonya Wiggins and JB Bradshaw. Despite being constantly spoiled by his 
          grandmother, Franklin had decided to take on the role of a street hustler. One of his first 
          jobs was selling cigarettes with Bradshaw. The scheme was successful until Franklin's 
          grandfather caught them in the act. In Tonya's words, his grandfather "gave chase to both him 
          and Bradshaw all around South Los Santos". After the death of his grandparents, Franklin and 
          his aunt Denise moved into a house on Forum Drive left to them by Franklin's grandmother in her 
          will.
        </p>

        <p>
          Franklin attended Davis High School along with <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Lamar_Davis" target="_blank">Lamar Davis</a>, Tanisha Jackson and Tonya, but was 
          expelled for assaulting a teacher for an unknown reason. Around this time, he began the life of 
          a gangbanger and dope dealer and started committing various petty crimes such as carjackings 
          and small-time bank robberies with Lamar. During their first bank robbery, they stole $2,000 
          but did not get to keep the money stolen, because a dye pack spilled onto the money, making it 
          worthless. Franklin also worked for a local drug dealer named Marcus, whom he later killed. 
          Franklin's life of petty crime caught up with him in 2008, when he was arrested and sent to 
          prison. After his release, he decided to give up his previous gang life and get some legitimate 
          work.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few months before the start of his story, Franklin moved beyond the role of ghetto-based 
          street dealer when he and Lamar began working for Armenian businessman Simeon Yetarian. 
          Yetarian owns a car dealership which acts as a front for a loansharking and extortion business. 
          Yetarian's dealership sells cars to people who can't afford them and when they default on the 
          exorbitant interest payments, Franklin and Lamar repossess the cars. Around the same time, he 
          receives a message from Tanisha that she is breaking up with him due to her brother's death and 
          fearing that Franklin's criminal lifestyle will bring her to harm.

          <br>
          ―Trevor Philips to <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_De_Santa" target="_blank">Michael De Santa</a>, in Bury The Hatchet
        </p>

        <p>
          Trevor was born and raised in <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Canada" target="_blank">Canada</a>, near the border with the United States, or 
          as he calls it - the "Canadian border region of America". In a conversation with 
          Franklin while hanging out, he claims he "grew up in five states, two countries, 
          fourteen different homes, eight fathers, three care homes, two correctional 
          facilities, one beautiful, damaged flower of a mother" and has "served time, my 
          country, your country and myself." Even as a child, he had a history of rage 
          issues and violent impulses that ruined his attempts to fit into society (
          notably, it is implied that he, in a fit of rage, sodomized his hockey coach with 
          a hockey stick and he implies in a conversation with Cletus that at some point he 
          strangled a clarinet player with his own instrument). Trevor also mentions how he 
          killed various animals and <em>"drifters"</em> even during the early years of his life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trevor's childhood itself was an unhappy one. His father was physically abusive 
          towards him, as stated in Hang Ten, while his mother was emotionally abusive, 
          overbearing, treated him with condescension and saw him as a "useless boy" who 
          cared little about his mother. When he was a child, Trevor's father abandoned him 
          in a shopping mall, which Trevor later burned down in retaliation. Trevor also 
          had a brother named Ryan, whom Trevor was not fond of. Ryan died in an <em>"accident"</em> 
          prior to 2013.
        </p>

        <p>
          As revealed by Trevor himself, Trevor dropped out of school, which is the 
          possible reason why he has a lack of some basic knowledge, such as the location 
          of ancient Rome, which he thought was a part of America. He also reveals that he 
          has problems with grammar and "improvises" when it comes to punctuation. It is 
          possible that he had some formal education, as he mentions during police chases 
          that he took a night class in criminal law (however this could be sarcasm).Trevor 
          has good mathematical skills, which is confirmed by Wade, who says that Trevor is 
          very good at <em>"numbers"</em>, but this statement could be due to Wade's even lower 
          intelligence. When playing golf, Trevor says that he was the Canadian under-18 
          Champion and "almost turned pro". Later in his life, Trevor discovered that he 
          had a talent for flying jets. He enlisted in the air force to fly fighter jets, 
          but several days prior to completing his training and becoming a licensed pilot, 
          Trevor was deemed mentally unstable by the <em>"witch"</em> in charge of psychological 
          evaluations, thus resulting in Trevor's discharge and grounding for life. It was 
          implied his discharge was due to his psychological relationship with his mother.
        </p>

        <p>
          After being discharged from the military, Trevor became a drifter and committed 
          petty crimes along the border with no particular goal in mind. He admits to Lamar 
          that he never committed any serious crimes until he met <a class="innerLink" href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_De_Santa" target="_blank">Michael Townley</a> in 1993. 
          They first met each other while escorting cargo across the border. Trevor himself 
          claimed that the money he was receiving for the job was good, along with the fact 
          that at the time he did not <cite>"know enough to check references."</cite> Trevor also tells 
          Lamar a story of how one time, Trevor and Michael were waiting on the runway to 
          meet their employers, Trevor sees not one, but two dust trails coming up the 
          road, despite the fact that he was told there would be only one person meeting 
          them. As the second guy drives through the gate, the second driver begins yelling 
          at Michael. Trevor gets close to him, shoots off a flare gun he was carrying at 
          the moment into the second man's eye, killing him. He and Michael both dump the 
          body into a lake after landing the plane. Trevor stated that going through the 
          turn of events was horrible, as the flare was still burning from the inside of 
          his head as they dropped him off, disgusting to the point that Trevor and Michael 
          threw up after landing the plane since the dead man's stench was still inside the 
          cockpit. After the incident, Trevor and Michael created a chagrined relationship 
          and criminal partnership.
