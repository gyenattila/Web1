      <h1>Red Ded Redemption II</h1>
      <p>
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is a Western action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. It was 
        released on October 26, 2018, for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. The third entry in the Red Dead series, 
        it is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. Set in 1899 in a fictionalized version of the Western United 
        States, the story centers on outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang dealing with the decline of 
        the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other enemies. The story also 
        follows fellow gang member John Marston, protagonist from the first Red Dead Redemption.
      </p>

      <p>
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is presented through both first and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam 
        in its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, hunting, horseback riding, interacting 
        with any non-player character (NPC), and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A 
        bounty system similar to the "wanted" system from the Grand Theft Auto franchise governs the response of law 
        enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. Red Dead Online, the online multiplayer mode of 
        the game, was released as a beta version in November 2018.
      </p>

      <p>
        Broadly anticipated and marketed before release, Red Dead Redemption 2 broke several records and had the 
        second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment, generating $725 million in sales from its opening weekend and 
        shipping over 23 million copies in retail. It was universally acclaimed by critics, who praised the story, 
        characters, open world, and considerable level of detail. Red Dead Redemption 2 received a number of perfect scores 
        and awards, including the "Critics' Choice Award" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, and honors such as "Best 
        Narrative" and "Best Score/Music" at The Game Awards 2018. <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2" target="_blank">Read more...</a>

      <h1>Grand Theft Auto V</h1>
      <p>
        Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It 
        was released in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and 
        in April 2015 for Microsoft Windows. It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand 
        Theft Auto IV. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story 
        follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency. The 
        open-world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based 
        on Los Angeles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by 
        vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch between them both during 
        and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving 
        gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. Grand 
        Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different 
        cooperative and competitive game modes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The development of Grand Theft Auto V began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV's release and was shared between many of 
        Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red 
        Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core 
        structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team 
        members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack 
        features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V" target="_blank">Read more...</a>

      <h1>Horizon Zero Dawn</h1>
      <p>
        Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive 
        Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in early 2017. The plot follows Aloy, a hunter in a world 
        overrun by machines, who sets out to uncover her past. The player uses ranged weapons, a spear, and stealth to 
        combat mechanised creatures and loot their remains. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and bonuses. 
        The player can explore the open world to discover side quests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Horizon Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Games' first intellectual property since Killzone in 2004 and also its first 
        role-playing game. Development began in 2011 after the completion of Killzone 3, with director Mathijs de Jonge 
        considering it the riskiest idea pitched at the time. The game engine, Decima, was developed for Killzone Shadow 
        Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. Anthropologists were consulted to authenticate the world's decay over a 
        millennium. The soundtrack, led by composer Joris de Man, contains experimental instrumentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Horizon Zero Dawn won numerous awards, and critics praised its open world, story, visuals, combat, characterisation, 
        and the performance of voice actress Ashly Burch; however, the dialogue, melee combat, and character models received 
        some criticism. By February 2019, the game had sold over 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling 
        PlayStation 4 games. An expansion, The Frozen Wilds, was released in November 2017. <a class="innerLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn" target="_blank">Read more...</a>
